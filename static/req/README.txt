Place website assets used by the UI here.

Expected file:
- logo.png  (the round Audio Atlas mark, used in header, hero badge, and favicon)

At runtime the app references it at:
- <img src="/req/logo.png" ...>
- <link rel="icon" href="/req/logo.png" type="image/png">
- <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/req/logo.png">
