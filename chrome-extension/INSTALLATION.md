### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need Chrome Canary?**  
A: Only if you want to use the Writer API for report generation. The extension works in regular Chrome, but report generation requires Chrome Canary with the Prompt API enabled.

**Q: Can I use this with a deployed Audio Atlas?**  
A: Yes! Just update the `appUrl` in `service-worker.js` to point to your deployed URL.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**  
A: No, Chrome extensions are desktop-only.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: Yes! The extension doesn't collect or store any data. It only passes image URLs to Audio Atlas.
