## 🚀 How It Works

### The "Spectrogram Hack" Pipeline

```
User uploads audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.)
           ↓
FileReader API reads as ArrayBuffer
           ↓
Web Audio API decodes to AudioBuffer
           ↓
FFT analysis extracts frequency data over time
           ↓
Canvas renders spectrogram image
           ↓
toDataURL() converts to Base64 PNG
           ↓
Existing VQA engine analyzes spectrogram
           ↓
User asks questions about audio content
           ↓
AI responds with frequency/time analysis
```

### Key Innovation

Instead of requiring a specialized audio AI model, this feature:
1. **Converts audio to visual** (spectrogram)
2. **Feeds visual to existing VQA** (multimodal Prompt API)
3. **Enables audio conversations** through visual analysis

## 🎭 New User Persona: Elena

**Elena Martinez** - Bio-Acoustics Researcher

Elena studies marine mammal vocalizations and can now:
- Upload underwater recordings
- Ask: *"Is a humpback whale song present in this clip?"*
- Ask: *"What is the dominant frequency range after 15 seconds?"*
- Ask: *"Are there signs of boat engine noise in lower frequencies?"*

---

## 💬 Example Queries

### Detection Queries
```
"What sounds are present in this audio?"
"Is there any speech or music in this recording?"
"Identify the main sound sources."
```

### Frequency Analysis
```
"What is the dominant frequency range?"
"Identify frequencies between 500 Hz and 2000 Hz."
"Are there any high-frequency components above 10 kHz?"
```

### Temporal Analysis
```
"When do the loudest sounds occur?"
"Describe the pattern over time."
"What happens between 5 and 10 seconds?"
```

### Pattern Recognition
```
"Are there any repeating patterns?"
"Describe the harmonic structure."
"Identify any sudden transients or clicks."
```

## 🧪 Testing the Feature

### Step 1: Upload Audio
1. Open Audio Atlas in Chrome Canary/Dev
2. Click "Choose File" or drag-and-drop an audio file
3. Watch console for progress messages:
   - "Audio decoded successfully"
   - "Generating spectrogram: X time slices..."
   - "Spectrogram progress: 0%, 10%, 20%..."
   - "Spectrogram generated successfully"

### Step 2: Ask Questions
Once the spectrogram is generated, ask questions like:
- "What can you tell me about this audio?"
- "What frequency range is most prominent?"
- "Describe any patterns you see."

### Step 3: Follow-Up Conversations
Build on previous answers:
- "Focus on the first 5 seconds."
- "What about the lower frequencies?"
- "Compare the beginning to the end."
