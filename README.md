# Audio Atlas

## Elevator Pitch

**Audio Atlas is a web application that transforms static visual data into rich, interactive, and conversational experiences, leveraging Google Chrome's on-device multimodal AI to make the web's vast repository of knowledge accessible to everyone.**

---

## The Problem

Millions of people with visual impairments face a critical accessibility gap when encountering visual data on the web. Charts, diagrams, maps, and graphs—which contain some of the most important information in academic papers, business reports, and educational materials—remain largely inaccessible.

> *"I can read the text of a paper faster than anyone, but when I hit a critical diagram, I hit a wall. It feels like the most important conversations in my field are happening in a language I'm not allowed to speak."*  
> — **Anjali Sharma**, PhD candidate in Biochemistry (Persona)

Traditional solutions like alt text are insufficient for complex visual data. A simple text description cannot capture the intricate relationships in a flowchart, the nuanced trends in a multi-series chart, or the spatial connections in a network diagram. Users need the ability to **explore, question, and understand** visual data interactively—just as sighted users can.

---

## The Solution

Audio Atlas leverages Chrome's **on-device Gemini Nano model** with the new **multimodal Prompt API** to enable true Visual Question Answering (VQA) directly in the browser. Users can:

1. **Upload** any chart, diagram, map, or graph
2. **Ask questions** via text or voice input
3. **Receive intelligent responses** that are both displayed and spoken aloud
4. **Have follow-up conversations** with full contextual understanding

The application serves two primary user personas:

### Anjali (Visually Impaired Researcher)
Needs to navigate complex scientific diagrams and flowcharts. Audio Atlas provides **spatial and relational navigation**, allowing her to ask questions like:
- *"Describe the path from glycolysis to the Krebs cycle"*
- *"What are the inputs to this process?"*
- *"Walk me through the main loop step by step"*

### David (Business Analyst)
Needs to extract precise data from charts and graphs quickly. Audio Atlas provides **precision data extraction**, allowing him to ask:
- *"What was the CAGR for the APAC region in Q3?"*
- *"What's the highest value on the Y-axis?"*
- *"Give me the exact percentages for each quarter"*

> *"If I could just ask, 'What was the CAGR for the APAC region in Q3?' and get an answer without having to squint at a dozen slides, I'd save hours every week."*  
> — **David Chen**, Business Analyst (Persona)

### Core Principles

Audio Atlas embodies Google's three pillars of on-device AI:

1. **Inherent Privacy**: All data processing happens on-device. Your sensitive academic or business data never leaves your browser.

2. **Network Resilient UX**: The core functionality works completely offline. No internet connection required after the initial page load.

3. **Creative and Economic Freedom**: Zero server costs. Zero infrastructure complexity. The entire application runs in the browser.

## How to Use

1) Analyze a visual (chart/diagram/map)
- Go to /upload, drop an image (PNG/JPG/WEBP) or click Choose File.
- Ask a question in the input box, or click the mic to speak.
- Try: “Give me a high-level summary”, “What’s the highest value?”, “Describe the flow step by step”.

2) Use voice
- Click the mic to start/stop listening. After dictation, we process and speak the answer back.

3) Analyze audio (spectrogram)
- Upload an audio file (WAV/MP3/OGG/FLAC/M4A). We generate a spectrogram automatically.
- Ask: “Where are the strongest frequencies?”, “Any repeating patterns between 2–4s?”, “Is there a loud transient?”

4) Multi‑image session + report
- Use the Chrome extension or open /analysis and load multiple images (extension passes imageUrl automatically).
- Findings are captured in Session Findings; click “Generate Summary Report” to create an executive summary with the Writer API.

5) Chrome extension
- Install from chrome-extension/ (Load unpacked). Then right‑click any image → “Analyze Image with Audio Atlas”.
- Audio Atlas opens at /analysis and auto-loads the image. Start asking questions.

6) Explain it simpler (when available)
- Click “Explain It Simpler” to rewrite the last answer in plain language (uses Rewriter API when supported).

7) Translate labels (when available)
- If non-English labels are detected, a banner offers translation (uses Translation API). Accept to translate labels to English.

## How It Works

### 1. Image Upload
The user uploads a visual data file (chart, diagram, map, etc.) via the `ImageUploader` component. The file is read as an `ArrayBuffer` and stored in the `imageStore`.

### 2. Query Submission
The user asks a question via text input or voice command through the `UserInput` component. Voice input uses the Web Speech API for speech-to-text conversion.

### 3. AI Processing
The `ai.ts` module:
- Analyzes the query to determine its type (summary, navigation, data extraction)
- Constructs an enhanced prompt with appropriate system instructions
- Includes conversation history for contextual understanding
- Calls Chrome's multimodal Prompt API with both the image and the enhanced prompt

### 4. Response Delivery
- The AI response is added to the `conversationStore`
- The `ChatInterface` displays the message
- The `speech.ts` module speaks the response aloud using text-to-speech
- The `StatusIndicator` announces state changes to screen readers

### 5. Follow-up Questions
Users can ask follow-up questions that reference previous responses. The full conversation history is passed to the AI model, enabling true conversational interaction.

## Key Implementation Highlights

### Intelligent Prompt Engineering

The `ai.ts` module implements sophisticated prompt engineering to serve different user needs:

```typescript
// For navigational queries (Anjali's persona)
if (isNavigationalQuery(prompt)) {
  systemInstruction = `System: You are an expert at interpreting diagrams, 
  flowcharts, and maps. Your task is to trace the connections and describe 
  the sequence of events or spatial relationships shown in the image in a 
  clear, step-by-step manner. Follow the arrows and connections logically.`;
}

// For data extraction queries (David's persona)
if (isDataExtractionQuery(prompt)) {
  systemInstruction = `System: You are a data extraction expert. When asked 
  for specific data points, values, labels, or trends from a chart or graph, 
  respond with the precise information. If possible, provide structured data 
  in your response.`;
}
```

### Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are fully keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA live regions announce state changes and new messages
- **Voice Interaction**: Full speech-to-text and text-to-speech integration
- **High Contrast**: Dark theme with carefully chosen colors for maximum readability
- **Focus Indicators**: Prominent focus rings for keyboard navigation

### State Management

Clean, reactive state management using Svelte stores:
- `imageStore`: Holds the uploaded image data
- `conversationStore`: Manages the complete chat history
- `appStateStore`: Tracks the current application state (idle, listening, processing, speaking)
