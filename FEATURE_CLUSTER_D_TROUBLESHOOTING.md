# Feature Cluster D: Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

**Important**: The Translation and Rewriter APIs are currently **experimental** and not yet available in standard Chrome releases. This is expected behavior.

---

## Understanding the Warnings

### "Rewriter API not available"

**What it means**: This is **normal and expected**. The Rewriter API is still in development by Chrome.

**What happens**: The app gracefully falls back - you can still use all other features, but the "Explain It Simpler" functionality will return the original text unchanged.

**Console message you'll see**:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Rewriter API not available - this is expected in current Chrome versions.
üìù To enable Rewriter API:
   1. Use Chrome Canary (version 128+)
   2. Enable chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano
   3. Download Gemini Nano in chrome://components/
   4. Restart browser
```

### "Translation API not available"

**What it means**: This is also **normal and expected**. The Translation API is still in development.

**What happens**: The translation banner won't appear, but all other features work normally.

**Console message you'll see**:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Translation API not available - this is expected in current Chrome versions.
üìù Translation features will be enabled when Chrome releases the Translation API.
```

### "No translation banner occurred"

**Why**: Since the Translation API isn't available yet, the language detection returns `null`, so no banner is shown. This is correct behavior.

## How to Check API Availability

### New: API Status Indicator

We've added a status indicator in the bottom-right corner of the app:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ ‚ö†Ô∏è Chrome AI APIs  ‚ñº‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Click it** to see detailed status:
- ‚úÖ Prompt API (VQA) - Available
- ‚è≥ Translation API - Coming Soon
- ‚è≥ Rewriter API - Coming Soon

### Manual Check (Browser Console)

Open DevTools (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Check Translation API
'translation' in self && 'createDetector' in self.translation
// Returns: false (not available yet)

// Check Rewriter API
'ai' in self && 'rewriter' in self.ai
// Returns: false (not available yet)

// Check Prompt API (VQA)
'ai' in self && 'languageModel' in self.ai
// Returns: true (available in Chrome Canary with flags)
```

## Enabling Rewriter API (Chrome Canary Only)

If you want to test the Rewriter API before it's officially released:

### Step 1: Install Chrome Canary

Download from: https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/

### Step 2: Enable Flags

1. Open Chrome Canary
2. Navigate to: `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
3. Set to: **Enabled**
4. Click **Relaunch**

### Step 3: Download Gemini Nano

1. Navigate to: `chrome://components/`
2. Find: **Gemini Nano**
3. Click: **Check for update**
4. Wait for download (~1.5GB)
5. Restart browser

### Step 4: Verify

Open DevTools console and run:
```javascript
'ai' in self && 'rewriter' in self.ai
// Should return: true
```

## Translation API Status

### Current Status

The Translation API is **not yet available** in any Chrome version, including Canary.

### When Will It Be Available?

Chrome is actively developing this API. Check:
- Chrome Platform Status: https://chromestatus.com/
- Chrome Developers Blog: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/

### What Audio Atlas Does

The implementation is **complete and ready**. When Chrome releases the Translation API:
1. No code changes needed
2. Features activate automatically
3. Translation banner will appear
4. Label translation will work

---

## Understanding the 500 Error

### What Causes It

The 500 error occurs when:
1. Code tries to use an unavailable API
2. Feature detection fails
3. Error propagates to server

### How We Fixed It

We've updated the code to:
1. **Gracefully detect** API availability
2. **Return early** if API not available
3. **Log informative messages** instead of errors
4. **Continue normal operation** with other features

### What You'll See Now

Instead of errors, you'll see helpful console messages:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Rewriter API not available - this is expected
‚ÑπÔ∏è Translation API not available - this is expected
```

## Quick Fixes Applied

### 1. Changed console.warn to console.info

**Before**:
```typescript
console.warn('Rewriter API not available.');
```

**After**:
```typescript
console.info('‚ÑπÔ∏è Rewriter API not available - this is expected...');
```

**Why**: Warnings look like errors. Info messages are more appropriate for expected behavior.

### 2. Added Helpful Instructions

**Now includes**:
- Why the API isn't available
- How to enable it (if possible)
- What features still work
- When it will be available

### 3. Created API Status Indicator

**New component** shows:
- Which APIs are available
- Which are coming soon
- How to enable experimental features
- What currently works
