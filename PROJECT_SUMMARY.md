# Audio Atlas - Project Summary

## Executive Summary

**Audio Atlas** is a flagship web application that demonstrates the transformative potential of Chrome's on-device multimodal AI capabilities. Built for the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025, it addresses a critical accessibility gap by making visual data‚Äîcharts, diagrams, maps, and graphs‚Äîaccessible through conversational interaction.

## The Challenge

Millions of people with visual impairments cannot access the wealth of information contained in visual data. Traditional solutions like alt text are insufficient for complex diagrams and charts. Audio Atlas solves this by enabling users to have natural conversations about visual data using Chrome's Gemini Nano model.

## The Solution

Audio Atlas leverages three key technologies:

1. **Chrome's Multimodal Prompt API**: Processes both images and text simultaneously
2. **Web Speech API**: Enables voice input and text-to-speech output
3. **On-Device Processing**: All AI runs locally for privacy and offline capability

## Core Innovation

### Intelligent Prompt Engineering

Audio Atlas doesn't just pass queries to the AI‚Äîit intelligently analyzes them and constructs specialized prompts for different use cases:

**For Spatial Navigation** (Anjali Persona - Visually Impaired Researcher):
```
Query: "Walk me through the Krebs cycle"
‚Üí Prepends system instruction for diagram interpretation
‚Üí AI traces connections step-by-step
```

**For Data Extraction** (David Persona - Business Analyst):
```
Query: "What was the CAGR for Q3?"
‚Üí Prepends system instruction for precise data extraction
‚Üí AI returns exact numerical values
```

**For Conversational Context**:
```
Query: "What about that step?"
‚Üí Includes full conversation history
‚Üí AI understands references to previous responses
```

## Technical Architecture
